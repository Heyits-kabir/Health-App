Project Summary: From Start to Finish ðŸŽ‰
1. How I Started
Starting with a complete backend, I built the frontend from the ground up using React (with Vite) and styled it with Tailwind CSS. I established a scalable project structure and implemented client-side routing with react-router-dom to create a multi-page application.

2. Core Feature Implementation
I then implemented all essential features, using React's Context API to manage state for user authentication and the shopping cart. I built the full authentication flow (registration, login) and secured the application with protected routes for user profiles and the admin dashboard. The core e-commerce functionality includes product browsing, a persistent shopping cart, and a full CRUD dashboard for admin product management.

3. Current Status
The project is now a feature-complete, full-stack MERN e-commerce application that showcases a wide range of my development skills.
