## Project Summary: From Start to Finish ðŸŽ‰
1. How We Started
We began with your completed backend and an empty frontend directory. Our first steps were to set up a modern and fast development environment using Vite to create our React application and integrating Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. Building the Foundation
Next, we laid the architectural groundwork for the frontend. We established a scalable project structure (with pages, components, context, etc.) and implemented client-side routing with react-router-dom. This transformed our single-page setup into a navigable, multi-page application with a persistent Navbar.

3. Implementing Core Features
With the foundation in place, we built out all the essential features one by one, debugging and refining as we went:

Product Browsing: We connected to your backend to fetch and display all products on a main page and created dynamic pages to show the details for any single product.

State Management: We implemented React's Context API as the "brain" of our application, creating an AuthContext for user sessions and a CartContext for e-commerce functionality.

User Authentication: We built the complete user flow: a Registration page to create new users, a Login page to authenticate, and a dynamic Navbar that reacts to the user's login status.

Protected Routes: We created PrivateRoute and AdminRoute components to secure user-only pages (like the Profile page) and admin-only sections, ensuring robust security and authorization.

Shopping Cart: We built a fully functional, persistent shopping cart where users can add items, view their cart, change quantities, remove items, and see a running subtotal.

Admin Dashboard: Finally, we built a complete admin interface for product management, allowing an admin to create, update, and delete products from the database through a secure frontend dashboard.

4. Where You Are Now
You now have a feature-complete MERN stack e-commerce application. It's a robust, real-world project that demonstrates a wide range of full-stack development skills.
